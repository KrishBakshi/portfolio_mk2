# Welcome to the Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post demonstrating various MDX features. We've set the banner image to use the requested banner.

## Rich Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even ~~strikethrough~~.

### Lists

Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item
- Item 3

Ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Blocks

Here is a React component example with syntax highlighting:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
  name: string;
}

export const Greeting: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded-lg">
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And here is a simple Python script:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print([fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)])
```

## Tables

Here is a comparison table:

| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Basic Formatting | ✅ | ✅ |
| Code Blocks | ✅ | ✅ |
| React Components | ❌ | ✅ |
| Custom Styling | ❌ | ✅ |
