# Advanced TypeScript Patterns

TypeScript's type system is incredibly powerful, offering features that go far beyond basic type annotations. Let's explore some advanced patterns that can make your code more type-safe and maintainable.

```typescript
const greeting: string = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Mapped Types

Mapped types allow you to create new types based on existing ones by transforming properties.

## Conditional Types

Conditional types enable type-level logic, allowing types to change based on conditions.

## Utility Types

TypeScript provides several built-in utility types:

- **Partial<T>**: Makes all properties optional
- **Required<T>**: Makes all properties required
- **Pick<T, K>**: Selects specific properties
- **Omit<T, K>**: Excludes specific properties

## Template Literal Types

One of the newer features, template literal types allow you to manipulate string literal types.

## Best Practices

1. Use strict mode for maximum type safety
2. Leverage type inference when possible
3. Create reusable type utilities
4. Document complex types with comments

These advanced patterns will help you write more robust and maintainable TypeScript code.
