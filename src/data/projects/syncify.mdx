## Overview

Syncify reimagines music streaming as a social experience. Built with real-time technologies, it allows users to create listening rooms where friends can join and listen to music together in perfect synchronization.

## Real-Time Features

The platform features live chat functionality, allowing users to discuss songs as they play, share reactions, and discover new music together. The synchronized playback ensures everyone in the room hears the same moment of the song at the same time, creating a truly shared listening experience.

## User Experience

With a sleek, modern interface and support for multiple music sources, Syncify brings back the joy of listening to music with friends, even when you're miles apart.
